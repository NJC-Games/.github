# Not Just Common Games
Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm golemax, the founder of this organization.
I created this organization to to be able to create and distribute small indie games which will aim to provide a vision of video games outside the standards.
We prefer to create and innovate rather than follow a set path.
We also want to be as transparent as possible while giving you freedom.

> Our games are not necessarily suitable for all audiences and We deny any responsibility for any problems with what we provide.
